# "Fearless Rails Deployment" Issues and Erratum

This repository acts as the official support forum for _[Fearless Rails Deployment](http://railsdeploymentbook.com)_.

A technical guide like _Fearless Rails Deployment_ can (and frequently does) run into problems with becoming outdated or having dependency issues. I do my best to ensure the guide works, but sometimes my best isn't good enough. :D

If you run into a problem, please submit it to this [repository's  issues page](https://github.com/fearless-rails/issues-and-erratum/issues).
